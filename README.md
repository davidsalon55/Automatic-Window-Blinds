Introducing Solar-Powered automated window blinds and Lighting Control that 
responds to where the sunlight is beaming and adjusts itself depending on the angle 
and height of the rays of the sun hitting the sensors. The prototype is self-powered using 
solar energy to power itself and will be using Arduino as the microcontroller processor. 
The prototype has two curtain blinds that will fold in horizontally and the other one will 
be a vertical one for a precise blockage of the sun that will be coming through the 
windows plane.

Developing the Prototype. The prototype design was sketched using the SketchUp 
application to produce a 3D model. The measurements of the prototype model were 
altered using AutoCAD, and the researcher ensured that they were properly adjusted to 
match the actual prototype. This adjustment improves and was made based on the 
measurements taken from the window of the café business where the prototype would 
be implemented.

This shows the entire prototype set, as well as the system's configuration once 
installed in the café shop. As indicated in the figure, the solar panel, battery, window 
curtain, and block-out cloth projector have already been built.
