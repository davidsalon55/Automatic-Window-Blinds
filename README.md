Introducing Solar-Powered automated window blinds and Lighting Control that 
responds to where the sunlight is beaming and adjusts itself depending on the angle 
and height of the rays of the sun hitting the sensors. The prototype is self-powered using 
solar energy to power itself and will be using Arduino as the microcontroller processor. 
The prototype has two curtain blinds that will fold in horizontally and the other one will 
be a vertical one for a precise blockage of the sun that will be coming through the 
windows plane.
